# Background
I try to keep my body and mind in shape. A part of this is to exercise. 
I am also a huge nerd, so I decided that I want to keep track of my the exercises, my work out occasion and individual work outs.

There is a lot of interesting data one should be able to extract from months of exercise.

# Starting out

Firstly, we have Exercises and Work out occasions.
The layout is adapted only for mobile devices. 
A work out occasion is basically a date and a bunch of exercises.
Currently the app is hacked togheter with some JS and a simple sinatra backend.
